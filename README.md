# Chart project task list:

1.	The current application uses mock const data to display chart. Please use included sample data in Data.txt to chart 3 cities temperatures over 6 days. One point per hour per temperature.
2.	Make the "Back 3 Days" and "Forward 3 Days" buttons work; chart display should show 3 days temperatures at a time and should pan back and forth over the 6 days of data. Panning outside of the 6 day range will show nothing.
3.  Make the table row clickable so when a row is clicked and highlighted, the corresponding line will be highlighted.
4.	Briefly explain approach to testing the applications.

The goal of the exercise is to see your approach to the problem and the structure of the code; if some details cannot be completed in a couple of hours that is acceptable.
